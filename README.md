# Library
In this project, I created a Library application that takes input from a user, and stores that input into an object.
We then use those objects to create new childs in the DOM and take the properties from the objects to display it
in the DOM.

Some trouble I had:
- Creating the objects and using their properties as children in the DOM

That was about it. The project was pretty simple.
